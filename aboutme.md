My name is Jonathan Mendoza, I am a senior at UTSA, working towards my B.S. in Physics. 
A few interesting things about me:
  - I am studying at Lambda school, working towards a career in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
  - I've had research internships through NASA, where we studied landing on Mars and the potential gains of such an accomplishment.
  - I have co-authored a paper in the Journal of Nanomedicine. 
  
### my history

I grew up as the first son of an Mexican immigrant.
